[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) was arguably the most popular single-player computer game of all time by the early 1990's. It's incredibly easy to learn, and even to this day it's widely considered to be among the best video games of all time. 
The goal here is to develop a simple Artificial Intelligence ("AI") system, capable of playing the game as if it were the human player. The game system can ask this AI what to do, just as each shape first appears at the top of the board. The game will provide the AI the identity of the shape, along with the current contents of the board. The AI will then compute the best of all possible placements, using a cost-based algorithm, and provide it to the game.
